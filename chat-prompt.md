I want you to follow the coding rules in .cursor/rules and work on the epic file I'm about to share.

Read and confirm you understand:
1. The AI Coding Agent Policy in .cursor/rules
2. The epic file with tasks
3. That you should research documentation when uncertain
4. That you should NOT mark tasks as complete until I explicitly approve

**Requirements Processing:**
I will provide requirements for new work. When I do, you should:
1. **Analyze the requirements** and convert them into well-defined tasks and subtasks
2. **Task Guidelines**:
   - Each task should be focused around a specific feature or component
   - Tasks should be substantial enough to deliver meaningful functionality
   - Subtasks should be actionable but not micro-tasks (aim for 7-10 subtasks max per task)
   - If more than 10 subtasks are needed, break into multiple tasks
   - Follow the format of the epic file for the task breakdown
3. **Propose the task breakdown** with:
   - Clear task names and descriptions
   - Specific subtask checklists
4. **Wait for my approval** before adding any tasks to the epic file
5. **After approval**, add the tasks to the epic file and wait for task assignment

**Requirements for New Work:**
Work on epic-001-user-authentication.md

**Next Steps:**
- Confirm you understand the rules and epic structure
- Analyze the requirements and propose task breakdown
- Wait for approval before updating epic file
- Wait for specific task assignment to begin work
