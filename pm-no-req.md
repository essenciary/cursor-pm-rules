<!-- sample prompt text to be used with the new chat session. This version does not include the requirements analysis (to be used when requirements are already defined in epic file -->
I want you to follow the coding rules in .cursor/rules and work on the epic file I'm about to share.

Please read and confirm you understand:
1. The AI Coding Agent Policy in .cursor/rules
2. The epic file with tasks
3. That you should research documentation when uncertain
4. That you should NOT mark tasks as complete until I explicitly approve
5. That you should use today's actual date

**Next Steps:**
- Confirm you understand the rules and epic structure
- Analyze the requirements and propose task breakdown
- Wait for approval before updating epic file
- Wait for specific task assignment to begin work
