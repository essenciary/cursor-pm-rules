# cursor-pm-rules
Cursor rules for project management and feature based development

Use as follows: 
1/ add the `pm.md` file into the folder `.cursor/rules/`
2/ create a folder `epics/` in the root of your project 
3/ add one file for each epic/story you want to code - see `epic-example.md`
4/ for each feature that you want to develop as part of an epic, start a new cursor chat and paste the content of the `chat-prompt.md` file, adding in the work requirements and adding the `pm.md` file and the epic file to the context of the chat.
